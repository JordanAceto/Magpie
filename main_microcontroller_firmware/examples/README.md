## This directory is for firmware example programs

- Each example is a contained firmware application that exercised a subset of the firmware functionality
- Examples are inteded to test, troubleshoot, and understand software modules and peripherals in relative isolation
- Each example should clearly show how the given module/peripheral is used and some expected use cases
- See the example subdirectory README files for specific instructions on how to build and flash, and what to expect
